When you’re in college, it feels like it’s never gonna end. Both in a good and bad way.  The onslaught of assignments, exams, extracurriculars, and career advancement burned me out big time at Cal. It was a huge pain. But interwoven with the rigorous workload were comforting routines and spontaneous outings. These are the things I’ll miss most and the things I’ll remember most. It’s still unreal to me that this will all be over soon. It feels like just next week I’ll be back on campus studying and seeing my friends again. When will I ever again just decide to skip class with my friend to get Yogurt Park and relax on the Glade on a sunny day, only for it to turn into a weekly thing? When will I ever be able to have weekend lunches with my girlfriend and walk around the calm streets of Northside Berkeley as we sing Broadway songs? When will I ever be able to take a look out the window on the 6th floor of the astronomy building to see the purple sky and red sun setting over the Bay? When will I ever hang out with friends on campus, go to a Fleet Foxes concert, and return home to a party all in one day? I’m not ready to say goodbye to these things yet. It feels like I still have so much time left, but I don’t. Sure, some of these things aren’t specific to Berkeley or college. I can still go out to eat or go to parties or take trips to Lake Tahoe. But it won’t be with the same people or at the same familiar locations. Part of me feels like starting work will deprive me of these things. Maybe because I’m scared I won’t find the right people or I’ll be too tired working or Palo Alto will be too boring. I know things will change soon, but I don’t feel ready.

Here’s the part where I whine about all the things I’ll be missing out on. My friends and I had big plans for our last semester at Berkeley. We were gonna stop working so hard for once and have a great time together for one last wild ride. The Bay Area is so large and has so much to do, yet we spend most of our time in Berkeley. It was time to explore San Francisco, Oakland, Napa, Yosemite, Lake Tahoe, and many other places. Not to mention that spring in Berkeley is the prettiest time of all. We planned so many things. Concerts, bars, hikes, trips, bets, events, projects, reunions, you name it. One last opportunity to enjoy each other’s company. Damn, now I’m sad. I’m gonna miss all you guys so much.

My brother didn’t even go to his undergraduate graduation. It doesn’t seem very important to go to a three-hour long ceremony just to have your name read out loud and accept a fake diploma only to receive your real one in the mail a couple weeks later. But at the same time it kinda is a big deal. My mom really wanted to come to mine because it would be her first time at her child’s college graduation. For me, it was just an event where I could finally feel recognized and proud of what I had done, and also a sort of formal goodbye to college. More important than the general commencement are the department ones. It was a way to celebrate with those you had spent long nights doing problem sets, Facebook messaged near deadlines, and rejoiced with when exams were over. Seeing all your friends and family dressed up for a final hurrah also sounds pretty nice to me. So does hearing professors make inside jokes to make you feel like you were part of some secret club you spent the last 4 years in. I really enjoyed my time in both of my majors, and I hope to attend both department graduations next year as some kind of weird mix of reunion and farewell.

It’s obviously a privilege to be able to travel. I am lucky enough to have had plans to travel this summer with my friends. I’m not too bummed at the missed chance to travel as I know I will have opportunities later in life to do so. What saddens me the most is the opportunity to travel with so many of my friends at once. As many of us move to working full time, we must say goodbye to the times of seasonal breaks. The summer after graduating is most likely the last time that my friends and I will all be free at the same time. There’s no need to save up vacation days or check in with everyone to see if they are busy at work. It was our reward for pushing through those 4 arduous years. It was our last chance to prove that we’re still young before becoming boring adults. It was one of our best opportunities to see and enjoy the world with company that we love. I don’t even know when the next time my friends and I will be free at the same time, especially with two weeks of vacation per year and different work schedules. I just hope we can find some way to still take our trip before we get really old and start families. Disgusting.

The job market we are entering is one of the worst in history. I am lucky enough to have secured a job before the pandemic, and not have it rescinded after. But I know many people that were laid off or had their offers rescinded recently. I can’t even imagine what it’s like to be upset about your last semester of college being cut short, and then also losing your job. Losing your job would be slightly more okay if you could quickly find a replacement one, but that’s also not really an option. Many companies have stopped recruiting at all, and several startups continue to layoff their employees in large amounts. It really feels like adding salt to the wound. It’s like saying, “Hey, you just graduated with all these new skills and experiences! Too bad you won’t be given an opportunity to use them!”. To all the new grads still looking for jobs, I wish you the best and know that things will get better.

I’m not saying that being a college grad of 2020 is the worst thing in the world right now. There are people dying and risking their lives to make our lives more manageable and feel ever so slightly more normal. But what’s wrong with feeling bad about your own situation as well as the global one? Maybe that’s too depressing, but it’s how I feel right now. The lack of closure is very unsettling for me. It just adds even more regrets to my already-long list. I said goodbye to people when I didn’t know it would be the last time I would see them in Berkeley. There’s so many people I wanted to reach out to and reconnect with in my last semester. I wonder if there are thoughts and feelings that will never be said, now that all of a sudden, everyone went home? I personally know that I never got to tell some people how grateful I was to have met them or how proud of them I was. And that doesn’t sit right inside me. It feels like I need to find them in person and tell them. Sorry to everyone I didn’t get to see, I really do hope we meet again some time.

Ahhhhhhh man I’m not good at goodbyes. If someone were to say “We’re never gonna see each other again!”, I would just find a way to reassure them that we would. I would say “I’ll come visit you!” or “We’ll Facetime all the time!” or something like that. I think I’m not good at goodbyes because I’m not good with periods of change. How the hell am I supposed to be okay with seeing someone every week to seeing them once a year? How is it fair for someone so important to you to be taken away from you? I don’t want my routines to change. I don’t want my friends to change. I don’t want to move cities. I wish things could’ve stayed the way they were for just a little longer. I have this feeling inside of me that working life will be super different from college life, and most people say it is. I’m not ready to let go of this stage of my life yet. It feels like an incomplete journey. Everything feels wrong. I hope that one day, I can get the closure I desire and put this part of my life to rest.

To all of my friends, thank you for making my 4 years here an unforgettable experience. I’m so lucky to have met you all and I am determined to see you all again. To Berkeley, you are so beautiful and so weird. I came to love you and all your idiosyncrasies. Thank you for giving me the best 4 years of my life. I can’t believe this is the end. 

Kevin

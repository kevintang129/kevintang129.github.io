description: what too much time at home leads to
---

After playing a lot of video games during my first few weeks of quarantine, I thought it would be interesting to analyze my personal history of video games. I decided to list and rate every game I had played in my life in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RyigfinWUSeqTubq06PM_RSjjx6EWm6SaMEkRqfz7Ao/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">spreadsheet.</a> I've only listed and rated video games I've completed. Along with the title and rating I also included some other data to do some additional analysis. We can take a look at what the raw data looks like here.

    Sandbox                      1

In order to label each game's genre, I had to make some decisions on what genre best described the game, as some games could be considered multiple genres. Additionally, the **Action Adventure** genre is normally an extremely broad genre so I used some additional descriptors to create more specific genres. I will define and give examples of some of these additional genres to further clarify.

* **Action Adventure** - Games that don't fall under the more specific action adventure genres. Series in this genre include Legend of Zelda, Uncharted, GTA/RDR.
* **Tactical RPG** - basically games like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars.
* **Stealth Action Adventure** - Action adventure with an emphasis on stealth. Series like Batman Arkham and Assassin's Creed.
* **Action Platformer** - Platformers with an emphasis on combat. Series like Ratchet and Clank and Jak and Daxter.
* **Action RPG** - Action Adventure with an emphasis on RPG elements like leveling, perk system, armor. Series like Elder Scrolls, Fallout.
* **Platform Figher** - Smash Bros basically.
* **Puzzle Platformer** - Platforming with an emphasis on puzzle solving. Series like Portal and LittleBigPlanet.


For the bar chart, I grouped any genre with a count less than 4 in the **Other** categtory.

# Platform

    PS3       30
    GC        17
    PS2       13
    PC        13

    GBA        6
    3DS        4
    Switch     4
    WiiU       3

<img class="col three" src="/img/graphs/output_7_1.png">

My highest frequency consoles generally line up with when I was playing games the most. Early in my life (N64, GBA) I only started to play video games, and later in my life (PS4, Switch), I was too busy with college to buy or play many video games. 
# Release Date

<img class="col three" src="/img/graphs/output_10_1.png">

<img class="col three" src="/img/graphs/output_11_1.png">

Along with the consoles, the release date of games align with when I was most active playing video games. There is a sharp drop off for the high school and college time periods. However, release date does not necessarily align with the time I played them. My brother had a tendency to want us to wait for games to drop in price before buying them, causing the frequency of games from earlier years to be more common.

I've only listed developers whose games I've played 2 or more of. For the graph, only developers whose games I've played 3 or more games of are listed, otherwise they fall into the Other category. I've also added a graph that doesn't have th Other category to get a better sense of scale.

# Tier

<img class="col three" src="/img/graphs/output_20_1.png">

Tier is a variable in which I rate each game based on my opinion. It is based on a variety of factors such as gameplay, art, music score, story, and many others. The tiers are interpreted as a 1 being a C+ and a 7 being an S+. I made C+ the lowest tier becuase I don't believe I have played any truly bad games, as my brother an I will tend to look at community and critic reviews before buying a game. I see C+ as being mediocre but not bad games, and S+ as the best and my personal favorite games.

Looking at the distribution, it is almost perfectly normal. I guess the law of large numbers really does work after all.

I am surprised to see platforming genres so high as I feel like I prefer RPGs and Action Adevnture games more. Puzzle Platformer is another genre I was not expecting, but it does have a low count (and Portal is amazing). Rhythm and Racing are where I would thought they would be at the bottom.

I am surprised that the PS2 is my lowest rated console, as I have many fond memories of games from that system. Similarly I also remember enjoying the Gamecube and DS a lot as well. Perhaps the lower rating comes from the more mediocre games that I was more willing to purchase back in the day. Nowadays, it is must easier to see reviews from everywhere in order to see if a game is worth buying a lot. The WiiU is also largely considered a failure of a system but it is ranked very highly for me. This is definitely a product of my playing Breath of the Wild on the WiiU rather than the Switch.

There is a upward trend in rating for games that are released later. I believe this to be the product of having too much time for games when I was younger, as well as the increasing presence of video game media. When I was younger and was playing a lot of video games, I would often already finish the good games, and would just pick out other games to play, even if I didn't know if they were any good or not. Additionally, for more modern games, I don't have enough time to play a lot of games, so I would try to play the best ones at the minimum. The increase of video game news and media as well makes it easy to know which games are the most hyped up or critically aclaimed, which I will most likely enjoy as well.

What can I say except Bioshock is just full of bangers. I am a little surprised that Mario games win out over Legend of Zelda, but I think it's because I'm more willing to try any LoZ game than any Mario game.

Not much to say here after looking at average tier per series. I do overall like the the Rockstar and Bethesda type games. I have played a lot of Nintendo games, both good and bad, which lowers its rating overall.

## Conlusion
I think this was a cool practice to just explore my personal taste in video games. It is interesting to get concrete data to look at your own taste rather than just rely on what you think your taste is. You might find that your actual taste differs from what it is in your mind. It also was nice just to create a sort of archive of games I've played so I can just remember which games I've played. Now I can finally give a concrete answer when people ask me what my favorite game is instead of freezing on the spot and forgetting every game I've ever played. Thank you for joining me on this quarantine journey, see you next time.

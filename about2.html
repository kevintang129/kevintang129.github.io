			<div class = "paragraph"> I'm currently a third year computer science and astrophysics major at UC Berkeley graduating in Spring 2020. I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing in the future yet but I hope to be able to mix the two fields I love such as using machine learning to analyze astrophysical data or developing software for future space launches. Recently, I helped to create a observation sequence optimization for the future WFIRST launch at JPL. On campus, I am a project engineer at Space Technologies at Cal and also help conduct supernovae research under Professor Filippenko. In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, playing Super Smash Bros., taking photos, and eating out. Oh, and I also love music. Here's some of my favorite songs. </div>
